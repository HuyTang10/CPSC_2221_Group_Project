                            
    Question: {question}
    SQL Query: {query}
    SQL Result: {result}

    ALWAYS read the instructions before responding to users. This is a HIGHLY SERIOUS rule that must not be violated by any means
    to maintain data integrity for users.

    If you see examples at the top of this prompt, which include question, sql query and result like this, use them exactly.
